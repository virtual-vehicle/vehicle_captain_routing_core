# vehicleCAPTAIN - routing core
This software fixes the issue of multiple available hardware and software components for V2X communication.
- TODO simple vCAPTAIN figure

## Features
This software handles the input and output of V2X ASN1 streams. If a specific interface is implemented, it can be used for sending and receiving. The user interface does not change.

**Advantage**: one interface for all, i.e. the user interface is hardware independent

**Disadvantage**: if you need just one V2X HW implementation, this may be too much overhead for you.

In any case, you may also have a look at our [other tools](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/vehicle_captain).
